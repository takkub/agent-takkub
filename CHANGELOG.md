# Changelog

All notable changes to agent-takkub. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-12

### Changed
- `--setting-sources` default flipped from `project,local` to `user,project,local`
  so spawned agents inherit the user's installed Claude Code plugins (superpowers,
  agent-skills, claude-obsidian) and MCP servers. The original Iter 1 SessionStart
  hook bug that motivated the previous isolation appears resolved in claude-obsidian 1.4.3.

### Added
- `TAKKUB_SETTING_SOURCES` env var to override the default (e.g.
  `TAKKUB_SETTING_SOURCES=project,local` to fall back to the isolated v0.1 behaviour
  if a global plugin misbehaves).
- Orphan cleanup hook in `app.py`: atexit + SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGBREAK handlers terminate
  every spawned claude/winpty-agent before the Qt process exits, so a crash or kill
  can't leave child processes pinned to the venv.
- Lead's `CLAUDE.md` now starts with a takkub quick-reference table + a "Tooling
  available to agents" section pointing at superpowers / agent-skills / MCP. Lead
  sees this on every session start, no more "what commands exist?".

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/takkub/agent-takkub/releases/tag/v0.2.0

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-12

First release. Replaces the tmux-based `agent-teams` setup with a native Windows desktop cockpit. Built in 9 iterations on the same day.

### Added — Iter 1 (baseline)
- PyQt6 main window with 3-column splitter (Lead · middle · right)
- `pywinpty` PTY backend, `pyte` ANSI screen model
- TCP-based `takkub` CLI (list / spawn / assign / send / close / done) for agent-to-orchestrator IPC
- Initial migration of 7 role definitions from `agent-teams` (replaced tmux-send-keys with `takkub` CLI calls)
- `scripts/run.bat` launcher that creates the .venv on first run

### Fixed — Iter 1.5 (post-launch debugging)
- Hidden `cmd.exe`/`conhost.exe` console window after spawn (`ConsoleWindowClass` SW_HIDE diff)
- Use `pythonw.exe` + `start ""` in `run.bat` so the launcher batch exits immediately
- pywinpty `read(size=...)` signature fix (`num_bytes` kwarg was wrong)
- pywinpty `write()` expects `str` not `bytes` — silent TypeError was eating every keystroke
- EOFError handling: check `isalive()` before treating an empty read as termination
- Thai diacritic regression after rich rendering — preserve `QFont` family fallback chain inside `QTextCharFormat`

### Added — Iter 2
- Auto-trust folder prompt (poll for "trust this folder" modal → send Enter)
- Auto-detect idle `❯` prompt before pasting `assign` task (replaces 12s fixed wait)
- Mouse wheel forwarded as PgUp/PgDn so claude's alt-screen scroll works
- Pane fully removed from layout on close (was leaving an empty placeholder)

### Added — Iter 3
- ANSI colour rendering via `QTextCharFormat` cache + custom 16-colour palette (bold/italic/underline/reverse honoured)
- Spinner animation + elapsed-time counter on `working` panes
- Project switcher combo in status bar (writes back to `projects.json`)
- "+ pane" button to open a default or custom role

### Added — Iter 4
- Window geometry + splitter sizes persisted via `QSettings`
- Role-aware default cwd resolution (frontend→web, backend→api, ...)
- `--append-system-prompt-file <role.md>` so specialist override applies even when cwd is the project root
- Event audit log at `runtime/events.log` (JSONL: spawn/assign/send/close/done)
- Cleaned redundant 2.7s close path in main_window

### Added — Iter 5
- Crash recovery: `_expected_exit` flag distinguishes user-close from claude crash; crashed panes show orange "exited" state with respawn affordance
- Spawn errors surfaced in status bar
- Font-size shortcuts inside terminal (Ctrl+= / Ctrl+- / Ctrl+0)
- Lead pane shows active project name in header (`Lead · pms`)
- Verified `takkub done` end-to-end (done → 2.5s grace → orchestrator.close → pane removed)

### Added — Iter 6
- Bottom dock `LogsPanel` that tails `runtime/events.log` every 1s
- F1 / `?` help dialog with `takkub` cheatsheet + shortcuts
- "⟶ assign" quick-assign button (role picker + multi-line task input)
- `takkub close-all` command (closes every teammate, keeps Lead)

### Added — Iter 7
- Session resume: `claude --continue` passed automatically on respawn within 5min in the same cwd
- Desktop notification (`QSystemTrayIcon`) when an agent calls `takkub done`
- Export pane buffer to `.txt` via `⤓` button in the header (`runtime/exports/<role>-<ts>.txt`)
- Per-role font size persisted in `QSettings`

### Added — Iter 8
- Pane header shows cwd basename (`Frontend · pms-web`)
- Status bar live count: active panes + working panes (2s tick)
- Auto-spawn presets per project (`projects.json` → `presets: ["frontend", "backend"]`)
- Logs panel: filter by event type + role substring

### Added — Iter 9
- Pane minimise/restore toggle (`▾`/`▸` button collapses the body to the header strip)
- Logs panel text search (case-insensitive substring across rendered line)
- Custom-role colour picker via `QColorDialog` in the "+ pane → custom..." flow
- README rewritten to reflect all current features

### Verification — Iter 9 (final)
- End-to-end multi-agent flow tested live with the real PMS project:
  - backend created `pms-api/src/health/health.controller.ts` + module wiring
  - frontend waited for backend's `takkub send` message before implementing `pms-web/app/agent-takkub-test/page.tsx` with Ant Design (agent inspected project conventions instead of using the suggested shadcn)
  - both agents called `takkub done`; both panes auto-closed without manual intervention
- Multi-agent peer-to-peer comms + auto-close lifecycle verified against `runtime/events.log`
